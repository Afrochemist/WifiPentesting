#This file will demostrate how to perform a fake authentication attack


Fake authentication is a type of wifi attack where the threat actor wants to compromise an AP with no devices connected to it. This type of attacks is the prereq to other wifi attack that involve the WEP encryption.

It happens in the following steps:

1) Inject packets to the network

2) On another terminal authenticate the wifi adapter to the AP( need to edit)
