#This file will explain WEP encryption
WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy. The purpose of WEP is to encrypt the data between
the client and the Access Point. The issue with WEP is that the encyption uses plain text
to encrypt the data which mean once the data is intercepted the threat actor can easily 
read the data. 


#Encryption
WEP uses RC4 encryption(symmetric encyption) which is used to encrypt as well as
decrypt the data. RC4 is made up two things which are Key Scheduling Algorithm(KSA)
and the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm(PRGA). Both are used to initiate the WEP key 
and create the keystream. 

Steps in Encyption:
- 1) The WEP key and IV  are appended and then the keystream is obtained

- 2) Integrity CHeck value is created and then appended to the message

- 3) Encryption takes place

Steps in Decryption:

- 1) Append the key ID and IV then obtain the keystream ran by the KSA and PRGA

- 2) XOR the encrypted message and the keystream which will lead to getting the message
and the ICV

- 3) Once the decrypted message is obtained compare it to the one receieved with the packet.
