Wifi enumeration is the process of gaining information on various wifi networks. Tools such as
Airmon-ng accomplish this. The fun begins after the wifi adapter is in monitor mode. Below are the commands
to change the wifi adapter to monitor mode. 

**Step 1** - find the name of the interface

iwconfig


**Step 2** - check for processes that prevent the wifi adapter from changing to monitor mode

sudo airmon-ng check

sudo airmon-ng check kill


**Step 3** - Change wifi adapter to monitor mode

sudo airmon-ng start <interface>

sudo airodump-ng

To get to this point type sudo airodump-ng <wifi adapter> in the command line.
- example ** sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon**

As you can see there are many columns. The following columns are to carry 
- Bssid column provides the MAC address of each AP that is in range. 
- Essid is the name of the AP. ENC provides the encryption for each AP. 
- Station are the machines connected to a specify AP.
- Channel location of the AP(need to edit)
- Enc encryption the AP is using(i.e. WEP or WPA2)
- Cipher
- Auth authentication the AP is using(i.e. SKA)



**Commands**
- looking at specific AP
sudo airodump-ng -c <channel number> <interface>
- looking at clients attached to an AP
- navigating airodump on the terminal
- mention aireplay-ng(prereq for various attacks)
- mention aircrack-ng(used to crack passwords)
- mention airgraph-ng(graphs nearby APs)
