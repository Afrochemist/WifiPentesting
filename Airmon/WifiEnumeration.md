Wifi enumeration is the process of gaining information on various wifi networks. Tools such as
Airmon-ng accomplish this. The fun begins after the wifi adapter is in monitor mode. Below is an 
example of what that looks like. 

**Need to format the steps better**

**Step 1** - find the name of the interface
iwconfig


**Step2** - check for processes that prevent the wifi adapter from changing to monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng check
sudo airmon-ng check kill


**Step3** - Change wifi adapter to monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start <interface>


[insert picture]


To get to this point type sudo airodump-ng <wifi adapter> in the command line.
