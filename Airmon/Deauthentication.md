Deauthentication is the act of pushing a machine off of an access point.
This comes in handy when password cracking an access point that has the 
WPA/WPA2 encryption. When a machine want to connect to an access point
it will send a request packet. Then the access point will send a response
response packet accepting/rejecting the machine.
